# Pipeline Monitoring System Architecture

## Design Decisions

### Data Structures
- **Choice**: Python dicts keyed by pipeline_id with defaultdict for metric aggregation; lightweight PipelineExecution objects for raw events; Alert instances for issues. These provide O(1) updates and fast lookups. For routing, nested defaultdicts map team -> severity -> alerts.
- **Trade-offs**: We avoid storing full time-series in-memory to keep memory usage low; instead we maintain incremental aggregates (success/failed counts, running averages). For richer trend analyses we would add fixed-size deques (ring buffers) per metric to bound memory while enabling rolling windows.

### Monitoring Strategy
- **Approach**: On load, each execution updates per-pipeline aggregates incrementally (O(1)). Health can be queried per pipeline or across all pipelines. Team metrics are aggregated from pipeline metrics.
- **Metrics**: Total/success/failed executions, success rate, average duration, average records processed, last execution time, team ownership. These capture pipeline health and throughput/perf.

### Anomaly Detection
- **Algorithm**: Peer-based statistical thresholds across pipelines using mean and standard deviation of per-pipeline aggregates. Detects: unusually low success rate, unusually high average duration, unusually low average records processed.
- **Thresholds**: Configurable k-sigma thresholds (1σ for success rate, 2σ for duration and records). Where stdev is 0 for success-rate, we apply a small fallback stdev to still catch outliers.
- **Severity Levels**: Severity scales with deviation: MEDIUM for moderate deviation, HIGH above a configured delta, CRITICAL for extreme deviations (>2x high delta). This yields multi-level alerting aligned with impact.

### Alerting System
- **Routing**: Alerts carry a team field. Intelligent routing groups alerts by team and severity via PipelineMonitor.get_intelligent_alerts(), returning team -> severity -> [alerts].
- **Deduplication**: Within a generation run, alerts are de-duplicated per (pipeline_id, message) key to reduce noise and oncall fatigue.
- **Escalation**: Severity classification includes CRITICAL for extreme cases, suitable for pager escalation; MEDIUM/HIGH can be routed to Slack/email. Time-based escalation (repeat firing) can be added atop stored alert history.

## Scaling Considerations

### Real-time Processing
- **Streaming**: Use a consumer (e.g., Kafka) feeding a stateless worker that updates aggregates in a shared store (Redis/Scylla). The current incremental O(1) updates are stream-friendly.
- **Event Processing**: Partition events by pipeline_id to ensure locality; employ at-least-once consumption with idempotent updates using execution_id.
- **State Management**: Persist aggregates per pipeline; use periodic snapshots and WAL to recover state quickly.

### Large Scale (1000+ pipelines)
- **Distributed Monitoring**: Shard by team and/or pipeline_id hash across workers.
- **Storage**: Column-oriented or key-value store (Bigtable/DynamoDB/Scylla/Redis) for aggregates; object storage or TSDB (ClickHouse/Timescale) for historical windows.
- **Query Performance**: Pre-compute aggregates; maintain indices by team. Batch export to OLAP for heavy analytics.

### Multi-Team Architecture
- **Team Isolation**: Namespace metrics and alerts by team; enforce authn/z at API layer.
- **Cross-Team Dependencies**: Represent dependencies in metadata and propagate upstream/downstream impact in alerts.
- **Permission Management**: RBAC over teams/pipelines; per-team API tokens.

### High Availability
- **Fault Tolerance**: Stateless workers with checkpointed state; retries on transient errors.
- **Redundancy**: Multi-replica consumers and replicated storage.
- **Recovery**: Snapshots + replay from event log to rebuild aggregates.

## Trade-offs Considered

### Accuracy vs Performance
- Using peer-based thresholds on aggregates is fast but less precise than per-run time-series modeling; acceptable for initial anomaly surfacing. For higher accuracy, use rolling windows or ML models.

### Storage vs Speed
- Aggregates minimize storage and maximize speed at the cost of historical granularity. Ring buffers provide a middle ground with bounded memory.

### Real-time vs Batch
- Current design supports near-real-time updating with batch-friendly file ingestion. A streaming adapter can reuse the same aggregation/anomaly logic.

### Granularity vs Overhead
- We track essential metrics to limit overhead. Optional debug-level metrics can be toggled if deeper visibility is needed.

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term (1-3 months)
- Add rolling window trend detection (consecutive failures, sudden regressions).
- Integrate Slack/PagerDuty notifiers.
- Implement alert suppression windows and SLOs.
- Add per-stage metrics and data quality signals (null-rate, schema drift).

### Long Term (6+ months)
- Move to distributed streaming architecture; persist aggregates in a scalable KV store; add TSDB for full trend analytics.
- Native integrations with existing observability stack (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus) and alert platforms.

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- Drop-in library or sidecar consuming pipeline events; expose a small HTTP/gRPC API for queries (health, anomalies, routed alerts).
- Webhook/queue outputs for downstream systems to consume alerts.

### External Tools
- Integrate with Slack, PagerDuty, Email via adapters mapping team and severity to channels/on-call schedules.
- Export metrics to Grafana/Looker dashboards via Prometheus or custom JSON endpoints.
